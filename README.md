Custom Slicer Profiles optimized for Ender 3 V2 Neo w/ Micro Swiss All-Metal Hotend + BLTouch

---

This project is a personal slicer tuning archive aimed at achieving:

- Maximum strength 
- Exceptional surface finish 
- High density, low porosity  
- Reliable first layers with consistent Z offset (`~ -1.90`)

These profiles are meant to produce parts suitable for small-scale functional production, including mechanical, structural, or aesthetic applications.
